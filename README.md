# Prime-Number-Generator
a CPU benchmark that generates a list of prime numbers.

This software can be used to generate a set amount of prime numbers, or generate a preset section of prime numbers for a benchmark.
The number of threads used can be changed to show the performance gains that come from multithreading. Worker or Task based scripting can be selected to see if any overhead is present in the two variants of C# Multithreading.
